Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI

I am delighted to share my latest project, an HR Analytics dashboard created using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that enables the creation of interactive dashboards, reports, and data analytics.

Project Description:
In this project, I focused on Employee Retention within the HR domain. I leveraged Power BI to create an insightful and visually appealing dashboard to analyze and understand factors influencing employee attrition.

Key Project Details:

*Domain: HR Analytics
*Project Name: Employee Retention
*Dataset Name: HR_1 & HR_2
*Dataset Type: Excel Data

Steps Taken in the Project:

*Connecting Data with Power BI: I started by connecting the HR dataset to Power BI, allowing seamless integration and access to the data.

*Data Cleaning and Transformation: Utilizing Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data to ensure its quality and consistency. I organized the data in a manner that is easily understandable and insightful for analysis. I also established relationships between the two datasets based on a common column.

*Additional Columns and Insights: To achieve the main goal of preventing employee attrition, I analyzed the data and created additional columns for better insights. These included:

-Employee's Attrition
-Stages of Employee's Work-Life Balance
-Employee's Age-Group
-Levels of Job Satisfaction

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Insights:
To extract meaningful insights from the data, I utilized various KPIs within the dashboard, including:

*Average Attrition Rate for all Departments
*Average Hourly Rate of Male/Female for each Job Role
*Attrition Rate vs. Monthly Income Statistics
*Average Working Years for each Department
*Job Role vs. Work-Life Balance and its Count
*Attrition Rate vs. Years Since Last Promotion Relationship

Visualizations Utilized:
To present the insights effectively, I utilized a range of visuals within the Power BI dashboard, including:

*Donut Chart
*Pie Chart
*Stacked Bar Chart
*Treemap
*Cards
*Slicers
*Matrix
*Table

This HR Analytics dashboard project demonstrates my proficiency in leveraging Power BI to create visually compelling and interactive dashboards. By analyzing key HR metrics, I gained valuable insights into employee retention and factors influencing attrition. The project showcases my ability to clean and transform data, establish relationships, and create informative visualizations to drive strategic decision-making in HR.
