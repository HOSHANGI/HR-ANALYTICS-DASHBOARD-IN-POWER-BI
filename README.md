🔹Here I created a Report on Employee Retention project report.

🔸Domain: HR Analytics
🔸Project Name: Employee Retention
🔸Dataset Name: HR_1 & HR_2
🔸Dataset Type: Excel Data

🔹Steps Taken in Project:

🔸Connecting Data with Power BI.
🔸Cleaned and transformed the data by using Power Query, Analysis the data accordingly and arrange it in understandable manner and then made relationship with both the datasets as both of them have one common column.
🔸Then as main goal was to prevent attrition rate of employees so found out the connection's of the columns with each other with respect to their records and created some additional columns like
🔸Employee's Attrition  
🔸Stages of employee's work life balance
🔸Employee according to their Age-Group
🔸Levels of Job Satisfaction

🔹KPI'S to retrieve insights:

🔸Average Attrition rate for all Departments
🔸Average Hourly rate of Male/Female for each Jobrole
🔸Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats
🔸Average working years for each Department
🔸Job Role Vs Work life balance and its count
🔸Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation.

🔹Used Visuals:

🔸Donut Chart 
🔸Pie Chart
🔸Stacked Bar Chart
🔸Tree Map
🔸Cards
🔸Slicers
🔸Matrix
